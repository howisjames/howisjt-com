DOUBLE PAGE LOAD
Try this quick test to see if Google Analytics is the culprit:
Temporarily comment out the Google Analytics line in your config.toml:

toml   # googleAnalytics = "G-74JZP84Q69"

Rebuild your site with hugo
Test if the double page load still occurs
If the double load stops, then the issue is with how Google Analytics is being loaded. Let Claude know the result, and I can help you fix it properly!
