description: A trip from Pete's Landing.
---

Pete's Landing is a boat ramp ($5 launch fee) into scenic Bayou Barbary, a tributary of the Amite River located in Livingston Parish south of I-12. Pete's is on hwy. 444, about midway between French Settlement and Killian, a little east of Hwy. 63. From the launch Barbary extends approximately 2 miles to the Amite.

# First Visit

I'd read of other's paddling trips on Bayou Barbary and recommendations from friends who fished the bayou from their powered boats. On the October Sunday when I first visited only two other vehicles were parked at the boat ramp so the bayou was quiet and peaceful. An approaching cold front brought windy conditions, so I first paddled up side channels to the east where the trees blocked most of the wind. On both of these I came to dead ends where the channels were choked with water hyacinths. Otherwise, the scenery is beautiful. 

I returned to the main Bayou Barbary channel and proceeded downstream towards the Amite River. Checking the time and considering the strong winds which would impede my return, I went only halfway down the bayou before turning around. Cool winds and mostly cloudy skies kept most of the wildlife out of sight. I didn't even see a turtle, though I saw plenty of bubbles. On a sunny day I'd expect to see them basking on logs. 

A highlight of the trip was spotting a limpkin near the boat ramp. I had seen numerous egg casings of apple snails during my paddle, which is the limpkin's food, and I'd read of their presence across south Louisiana. As a former resident of Florida's gulf coast I regularly saw limpkins along the freshwater waterways. I was pleased to see one here in Louisiana, following the spread of the invasive snails.

# Future Visits

We visited again about a month later and paddled the length of the bayou down to the Amite River and back. We spent two hours paddling down and back, plus up and back on a scenic side channel.
