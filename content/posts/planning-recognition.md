description: Awards and Achievements

---

I am fortunate to have worked on projects which have received awards, and also recognized for my professional and volunteer efforts with the American Planning Association - Louisiana Chapter. I thought I'd use this post to keep track of them. At one event in Monroe I got a photo with then-APA President Paul Farmer, FAICP and at another in Alexandria I was able to get a picture with Louisiana Lt. Governor Billy Nunguesser.
