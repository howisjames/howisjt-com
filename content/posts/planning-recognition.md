![Paul Farmer, FAICP and myself](/images/planning/recognition/paul-farmer-and-me-275.jpg#floatright)Look, I'm not going to suggest that awards are just piling up on my desk, but I am fortunate to have worked on projects which have received awards, and also recognized for my volunteer efforts with my professional organization, the American Planning Association - Louisiana Chapter. I thought I'd use this post to keep track of them. I even got a photo with then-APA President Paul Farmer, FAICP at one of our state conferences held in Monroe.
