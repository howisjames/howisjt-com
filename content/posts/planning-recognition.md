![Paul Farmer, FAICP and myself](/images/planning/recognition/paul-farmer-and-me-275.jpg#floatright)I am fortunate to have worked on projects which have received awards, and also recognized for my professional and volunteer efforts with the American Planning Association - Louisiana Chapter. I thought I'd use this post to keep track of them. At one event in Monroe I got a photo with then-APA President Paul Farmer, FAICP and at another in Alexandria I was able to get a picture with Louisiana Lt. Governor Billy Nunguesser.

My firm facilitated stakeholder engagement efforts. Located in the Spanish Lake Basin of east Iberville Parish, near St. Gabriel, Louisiana, SLEEC is the brainchild of the late Scott Nesbit of Natural Resource Professionals, LLC who envisioned that lands held by private interests - such as wetland mitigation banks - could allow for controlled visitation and use by the public through a single entry point featuring an environmental education center.
