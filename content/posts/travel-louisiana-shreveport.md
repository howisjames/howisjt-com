description: Fun things in Shreveport
---
Shreveport is my wife's hometown so we  get there fairly regularly. Here are a few places I like to visit.

## Eats
While there's more to do in Shreveport than eat, let's just say that there is no reason to go hungry while you're there...

### Herby K's
Home of the shrimp buster sandwich.\
They take about three jumbo shrimp and butterfly them, lightly deep fry them, and drop them on a poboy bun with lettuce and tomato. Add some Tabasco hot sauce and fries on the side and it is a lunch to remember.
 
### Superior Grill
It's the original. It's superior. 'Nuff said.\
But this is such an institution that I must ramble on. I first heard of this restaurant from a friend who attended Louisiana Tech. He and his fraternity brothers would drive from Ruston to Shreveport just for "the Cadillac Bar", which was the early name for Superior Grill. Thursday night happy hours were legendary. Their Shreveport location was so successful that Superior opened a second location in Baton Rouge. Knowing what was offered in Shreveport, we  LSU students watched in eager excitement as construction of the new location on Government Street took form. Twenty years later they've opened a second location in south Baton Rouge, and one in New Orleans' garden district. Everyone in the family looks forward to any opportunity for lunch or dinner at Superior.

Obviously there are other good eats in Shreveport. These are some of my favorites.

## History
### Waterworks
The historic Shreveport Waterworks museum is on the north side of downtown. Dating from the late 1800's, the facility has the pumps, filters, and similar facilities used to provide the early city with potable water.

### Spring Street Museum
I'm sad to admit I've not had an opportunity to tour the Spring Street Museum. My visits to Shreveport when I have extra time is usually a holiday, and the museum is closed. It occupies a bank building dating from the mid-1800's. I've walked by and looked in a couple of times and the exhibits seem interesting.

## Culture
### R.W. Norton Gallery
Not in downtown, this art gallery is in the Broadmoor neighborhood on Creswell, near Line Ave. and Pierremont Rd. This public amenity is the result of oil money and houses many works by western artists Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell. They also have one full set of Audubon's *Birds of America* elephant folios. The building itself is interesting, and the botanical gardens behind are quite beautiful. Oh, and it's free.

### Shreveport Municipal Auditorium
This historic downtown structure was the home of the Louisiana Hayride radio show which was a landmark in early country music. There's also a statue of Elvis in front who performed here.
Another historic building is The Strand theater. 

### American Rose Center
The Rose Society's Rose Center is well west of Shreveport's airport and is a nice place to take a walk on a nice day spanning over 100 acres of pinelands. The gardens are now in the middle of a multi-year total restoration. I'm looking forward to a return visit to see the improvements. Spring and fall are the best times to visit when the weather is mild and the plants offer the most blooms.

### Marlene Yu Museum / Rainforest Art Foundation
This contemporary art museum in downtown Shreveport features some very large scale and interesting works. I got to visit as part of a professional conference social event.

These are just a sampling of the places with which I'm familar. I know there are others as downtown Shreveport has been making good strides in redeveloping and enlivening Texas Street and other corridors.
