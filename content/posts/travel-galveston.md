Our family spring trip this year will be to Galveston, Texas for Easter weekend. As they attend different schools, our son's spring breaks didn't coincide, so four days at Easter was the best we could do. Galveston Island is roughly a 5-hour drive from home, so we will be able to get three nights, two full days, and two half-days of fun out of this family trip. We rented an Air B&B cottage next to Galveston's "Silk Stocking" district. It is pet-friendly and has a fenced backyard so our dog Woody can travel with us. I think he will love exploring nearby Kempner Park just two blocks away.

## Trip Prep
As we settled on Galveston, I started searching for travel library books, reading blogs, and listening to Galveston-related podcasts. I found some real jewels which I'll share here. Using these resources, and after reserving our accomodations, I built another web-map of attractions we may wish to see during our stay. The points on this map are pulled from a Google Sheet.

## Researching History & Culture

I discovered and soon got hooked on listening to J.R. Shaw's [Galveston Unscripted](https://www.galvestonunscripted.com/) podcasts. He's been recording these now for about three years and the show focuses on historical topics. His guests have deep knowledge of various aspects of the island's history, architecture, and attractions; and the interviews tend to last 40 to 50 minutes. J.R. has created a free resource of self-guided audio tour recordings, most lasting no more than 8 minutes and these are displayed as pin points on a map. I borrowed from J.R.'s technique, creating [my own pin map](https://howisjames.github.io/maps/galveston/) of Galveston island attractions that are of interest to me, and linking each to websites or audio podcasts with more information. Galveston Unscripted was inspired by podcast interviews by a mentor at [galveston.com](https://www.galveston.com/) during the early 2000's. (I've not been able to locate the repository of these older podcasts which Shaw mentioned during one of his GU shows.)

[Galveston.com](https://www.galveston.com/) has its own set of resources for visitors including a [blogs](https://www.galveston.com/blogs/) section, a [self-guided tour](https://www.galveston.com/whattodo/tours/self-guided-tours/) section and more. The site seems to have loads of free content, but on the whole the website seems to load slowly, which I find off-putting. 

I searched my local library system here in Louisiana, but despite Galveston's proximity, I was surprised to find almost no history or travel guide books aside from one children's book.

## Getting Around

Our accommodations are two blocks from the [trolley line](https://www.galvestontx.gov/1209/Trolleys) on Rosenberg Ave. (25th Street) which links us both to the seawall beach at Pleasure Pier and also to The Strand and Seaport area downtown. I doubt the trolleys will be dog-friendly, so we'll likely be driving everywhere.

# Trip Recap

During and following our trip a selection of interesting notes and photos will be posted below. I'll "pencil in" an outline to make it easier for me to post content on the go.

### The Air B&B House

How were our accomodations?

### Galveston Beach

Impressions of Seawall Beach, East End, and any other beach areas we visit.

### Historic Downtown

Impressions of Galveston's historic downtown.

### Bolivar Ferry

I'm hoping either to arrive or depart via the Bolivar Peninsula, which allows us to cross the ship channel on the free Bolivar auto ferry.

### The Food

We're pretty spoiled with good food here at home in south Louisiana. I wonder how Galveston's restaurants will compare?
