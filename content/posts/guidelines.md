I've implemented Disqus commenting my this blog because I hope to learn from you, dear reader. From experience, I know that the responses in these commenting sections is often more informative than the author's original post. This seems particularly true of technical blogs, perhaps less so of travel or hobby blog posts which are, of right, the opinion of their author.

So I look forward to reading your comments with the understanding that I won't tolerate rudeness. It's my site, my host, my stories, and - although Disqus holds and retains what you type on their servers - what appears on my pages is most definitely within my control. Below are some general policies you may follow to avoid having your comment purged or being blocked entirely.

## Stay On-topic

Be sure your topic contributes to the post narrative. This is a personal blog about diverse subject areas, so I'm allowing a bit of leeway here. But still, what you say should have something to do with what's in the post.

## No Self-promotion

A discussion or comment that contains only a link to your blog, a product, or your article on another site will almost always be removed.

## Choose Your (Curse) Words Wisely

Comments that contain profanity are automatically held for moderator review before being posted. Depending on the context of the comment, it may be removed. Profanity used to insult, antagonize, or inflame will always be removed.

## Don’t Be a Jerk

Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. Sexist, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are simply not allowed. Comments or discussions written intentionally to provoke will also be removed.

## Don’t Copy and Paste

If you didn’t write it, or haven’t properly cited the article you’re quoting, don’t post it here. 
*Note that these community guidelines have been obtained from suggested guidelines in the help section at disqus.com.*

## English Only

English is the only language I understand. I greatly admire folks who are bi- or multi-lingual. Sadly, despite a few years of high school French, I'm not one of them. Disqus channels support English-only discussions. Non-English comments and discussions will be removed. Sorry.\
