description: One of the Six Sisters of the Gulf Coast.
---
We were attracted by the art and mystique of Walter Anderson. And we discovered so much more to enjoy as my wife and I visited Ocean Springs - one of the *Six Sisters* of the Gulf Coast - in celebration of our anniversary. 

## The Six Sisters

In times past - during our country's antebellum period - city folk of means from New Orleans, Jackson and Mobile sought to escape pre-air-conditioned urban life to spend their summers enjoing sea breezes, "healing" spring waters, and good times along Mississippi's Gulf coast. Small coastal towns advertised their accomodations, food and drink as Six Sisters](https://mississippiencyclopedia.org/entries/six-sisters-of-the-gulf-coast/) grew to be known as Gulf Coast resort cities. Initially served by steam ship, by the 1880's a railroad line linked New Orleans to Mobile through these towns and locked in their role as coastal resorts. From west to east the towns (now cities) are Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Gulfport, (Mississippi City,) Biloxi, Ocean Springs and Pascagoula. The map below shows these Six Sisters linked by US Highway 90 (part of the [Old Spanish Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Spanish_Trail_(auto_trail)),) and they are now of course served indirectly by Interstate 10.

## Lodging

I intended to stay at a quaint B&B in the heart of Ocean Springs and largely succeeded, except that most of these botique inns don't serve meals. Turned out to not be an issue since there are so many delicious eateries within walking distance. We stayed at the [Springs Hotel](https://www.springshotelos.com/) located on Washington Ave. in the heart of O.S. next to the Walter Anderson Museum. It was within easy walking distance to the shops, restaurants and bars along Government Street. 

## Arts & Culture

The Anderson family readily admits that Walter was something of a peculiar man. He viewed the world and societal norms differently than most. Anderson passed away in 1965 before receiving any significant noterietary for his art, which took off in the mid 1970s. Anderson loved nature during a time when the hippie movement wanted people to love each other. Anderson's art reflects this and the time he spent alone in nature - even sailing a tiny one-man boat 11 miles offshore to Horn Island and even 25 miles offshore to Louisiana's Chandeleur Islands. I've recently spent a night [solo camping on nearby Deer Island]({{< relref "travel-mississippi-camping.md" >}}) and decades ago visited West Ship Island by [tourist ferry](https://msshipisland.com/) which is fun and interesting both with sandy beaches, clearer Gulf waters, sightings of dolphins, and a tour of historic [Fort Massachusetts](https://www.nps.gov/guis/learn/historyculture/fort-massachusetts.htm) maintained by the National Park Service.

### Walter Anderson Museum

(Decendents dislike "museum" in the name, finding it limiting.)

I'll describe the gallery and exhibits after our visit.

### Shearwater Pottery
(named after a mis-identified shorebird)

Shearwater Pottery was also founded by the Anderson family - was it by Walter's parents? - and he and his siblings worked there although Walter's interests were drawn more towards painting. The business was named after the Black Skimmer, misidentified as a Shearwater. Still, the name stuck and even the road was named after it. Fortunately, several species of Shearwaters do roam the Gulf of Mexico, though as pelagic species they are infrequent visitors to the shore.

I'll describe after our visit.

### The "Mary C"

The [Mary C O'Keef Cultural Arts Center](https://www.themaryc.art/) occupies the historic high school building on Government Street just east of the core business and entertainment district in Ocean Springs. The center includes galleries, a history museum and performace space for regularly scheduled events.
