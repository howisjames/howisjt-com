      <description>The name Fort Leavenworth has always had ominous connotations to me. At the occasion of my oldest brother&amp;rsquo;s military retirement ceremony, I was presented a chance to go see for myself. The place is beautiful, perhaps not inside the prison itself, but Fort Leavenworth as a whole is quite attractive. The Santa Fe and Oregon trails crossed the Missouri River here at Ft. Leavenworth, and you can still see the depressions from the wagon trains.</description>
