      <description>Texas offers loads of interesting places, landscapes and outdoor activities - yet I&amp;rsquo;ve visited the state only a few times, with just one visit to a few parks in the Austin area. A few photos from this trip are below. This blog is to explore potential tent-friendly campsites and attractions or points of interest that we&amp;rsquo;d like to visit and experience as a family.
Potential Campgrounds As usual I began my search by looking at maps.</description>
