      <description>Our family spring trip this year will be to Galveston, Texas for Easter weekend. Galveston Island is roughly a 5-hour drive from home, so we will be able to get three nights, two full days, and two half-days of fun out of this family trip. This will be our first pleasure trip into Texas as a family. We rented an Air B&amp;amp;B cottage next to Galveston&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Silk Stocking&amp;rdquo; district. The rental is pet-friendly and has a fenced backyard so our dog Woody can travel with us.</description>

      <description>Texas offers loads of interesting places, landscapes and outdoor activities - yet I&amp;rsquo;ve visited the state only a few times, with just one visit to a few parks in the Austin area. A few photos from this trip are below. This blog is to explore potential tent-friendly campsites and attractions or points of interest that we&amp;rsquo;d like to visit and experience as a family.
Potential Campgrounds As usual I began my search by looking at maps.</description>
