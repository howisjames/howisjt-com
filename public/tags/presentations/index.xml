      <description>Death by PowerPoint is a comic metaphor for the all too common use of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s product to produce and deliver the most dull, uninspired, and sleep inspiring lectures imaginable. Certainly, the software itself isn&amp;rsquo;t the culprit - it&amp;rsquo;s the uninspired user.
