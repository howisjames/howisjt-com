      <description>Reports of car and home burglaries in and around my neighborhood reported on the NextDoor app persuaded me to investigate a low-cost home security camera system. Many neighbors already have them so I figured &amp;ldquo;why not.&amp;rdquo; Much inspiration for the system I built came from TechnoDadLife and from Peyanski on Tech. Because I already had an older Dell Core 2 Duo desktop set up as a home NAS using OpenMediaVault, I decided to simply install a CCTV monitoring application onto that LINUX box since a) it is already running 24/7 and b) its use as a NAS is infrequent - meaning family members rarely access it so the computer has plenty of resources to spare.</description>
