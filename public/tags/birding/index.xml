      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in and fascinated by birds since childhood. During my high school and college years I forgot about it, not picking it back up again until I began my professional career.
Rekindled Interest My coworker Scott Knaus corrected my mis-identification of a chickadee, which I had foolishly called a &amp;ldquo;Black Capped&amp;rdquo; and he informed me it was more likely a &amp;ldquo;Carolina&amp;rdquo;. Oh, right. Many would have left it right there, but as my education included plant science and I appreciated the concept of &amp;ldquo;species,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;variety&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cultivar,&amp;rdquo; I understood Scott&amp;rsquo;s point immediately.</description>
