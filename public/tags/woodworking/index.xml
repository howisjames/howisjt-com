      <description>Having successfully built three recreational kayaks constructed of marine-grade plywood using the stitch-and-glue method I had some surplus materials remaining and decided to pursue another boat project. The idea of stand-up paddleboarding (SUP) appealed to me &amp;mdash; and to my sons also &amp;mdash; so we decided to build a board rather than another kayak.
