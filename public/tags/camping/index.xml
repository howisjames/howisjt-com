      <description>Texas offers loads of interesting places, landscapes and outdoor activities - yet I&amp;rsquo;ve visited the state only a few times, with just one visit to a few parks in the Austin area. A few photos from this trip are below. This blog is to explore potential tent-friendly campsites and attractions or points of interest that we&amp;rsquo;d like to visit and experience as a family.
Potential Campgrounds As usual I began my search by looking at maps.</description>

      <description>Camping in several of Florida&amp;rsquo;s State Parks has been very enjoyable trips creating fond memories. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll list them by region within the state.
Big Lagoon State Park, Pensacola - camp siteSouth Florida The Florida Keys I&amp;rsquo;ve been camping in the Florida Keys twice. Both were very short, one night visits. The first was in a private campground down close to Key West. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall the name or specific location.</description>

      <description>The kitchen and food prep is always a challenge when tent camping with the family. As a kid my dad took us camping in western North Carolina and I (vaguely) recall a rather elaborate setup with two large tents facing each other, and a heavy canvas tarp stretched in between, covering and protecting our dining and cooking area. There were boxes of food and supplies, large ice coolers, a Coleman stove and more.</description>

      <description>My sons and I have enjoyed several tent camping trips in Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Sometimes, their friends have gone with us, and one trip was a church youth trip (which you&amp;rsquo;ll agree, aren&amp;rsquo;t typical camping trips.)
North Louisiana Caney Lake Campground - above Minden was a fun trip with our cousins. We all shared a campsite and everyone managed to find a space to spread out their sleeping bag in one of two tents.</description>

      <description>Mississippi offers several beautiful campgrounds within an easy drive of Baton Rouge.
South Mississippi All of my tent camping experience in Mississippi has been in the southern part of the state. It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonably short drive from my home in Baton Rouge.
Clear Springs in Homochitto Forest Clear Springs campground is a hidden gem. Forest camping is terrific here surrounding this beautiful reservoir and facilities constructed during the Works Progress Administration.</description>
