      <description>At the end of my dad&amp;rsquo;s construction career he designed and built his grand finale - a home for his bride in her hometown. I was still in school at LSU but found time to draft plans for my parent&amp;rsquo;s lake house. The home was constructed into the hillside and of course excavation, grading, and utilities left scars. The intent of my landscape plan was to heal these scars and to reunite the home with the surrounding woodland.</description>

      <description>My wife and I were homeowners in the Southgate Ridge neighborhood of Sarasota, Florida. It was a typical retiree bungalow repurposed as a starter home located south of downtown and less than five miles from the beach; add another mile if you simply had to continue north to the Siesta Key Beach pavilion. The home was simple, had only one bathroom, but it was paradise. About a year into our ownership, long enough to recover from all of those extra closing costs, we were ready to re-landscape the front yard.</description>
