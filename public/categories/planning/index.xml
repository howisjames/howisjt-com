      <description>Look, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to suggest that awards are just piling up on my desk, but I am fortunate to have worked on projects which have received awards, and also recognized for my volunteer efforts with my professional organization, the American Planning Association - Louisiana Chapter. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d use this post to keep track of them. I even got a photo with then-APA President Paul Farmer, FAICP at one of our state conferences held in Monroe.</description>

      <description>Death by PowerPoint is a comic metaphor for the all too common use of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s product to produce and deliver the most dull, uninspired, and sleep inspiring lectures imaginable. Certainly, the software itself isn&amp;rsquo;t the culprit - it&amp;rsquo;s the uninspired user. But in an effort to &amp;ldquo;think out of the box&amp;rdquo; I decided to prepare and deliver a couple of lectures using on-screen presentation frameworks other than PowerPoint.
Presi Yes, Presi is a commercial product too, and it is now associated with disorienting, spinning on-screen shows that can give the audience indigestion.</description>
